4. Your changes will go through our integration checks and test suite.
5. Once the integration checks pass, your changes will be merged into ```expertiza:beta```
6. The changes will now be exposed to limited population for beta testing.
7. One/Many fixes and features including yours will be bundled together from ```expertiza:beta``` and merged into ```expertiza:master``` as per our deployment cycle.
